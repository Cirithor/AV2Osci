# AV2Osci
Inspired by w2aew's analog video to oscilloscope videos (https://youtu.be/5FYF5uhCzAM AND https://youtu.be/yf4kOMSPbM0) I created a circuit which let's you watch analog video on most oscilloscopes with X, Y and Z-channel.
My goal was, to make this circuit as flexible as possible. So that at least every one of my oscilloscopes are working great.
